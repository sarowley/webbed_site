        Archipelago is a fast paced movement roguelike set on a cluster of
        floating islands. <br /> <br>
        It was my senior capstone project while I was attending the University of
        California Santa Cruz. It was made in Unreal Engine 5 in the course of
        two quarters (20 weeks) by a team of 5 students (for the first 10 weeks)
        and then 7 students. It was the first time any of us had used Unreal
        Engine, along with the fact that some of my teammates didn't know C++,
        so sadly it's mostly in Blueprints.
        <br /> <br>
        This is also my first game to ever be published so it holds a special
        place in my heart.

        Level Design:
        <br />My roommate

        and I were in charge of and did all the level design for the game. The
        game is a roguelike, so we had to put a lot of work into making
        randomized play spaces that were coherent and fun to run around. I also
        worked on the level design of the tutorial to make sure that the player
        could get a feel for our game and learn everything they needed to.<br />
        <br />
        Twitch Interactivity:
        <br />I was the sole programmer on making our game able to interact and
        connect with the streaming service Twitch. It was honestly probably one
        of the hardest things I've ever done. It was given to our team by the
        professors as a "pivot" to replicate what trying to get a game published
        would be like. I used an Unreal Engine Plugin to make a fully functional
        login system for Twitch, along with creating, testing, and balancing 11
        unique Twitch commands for viewers to be able to use on the streamer.<br />
        <br />
        Gameplay Programming:
        <br />Along with most of the other people on the team, we would all chip
        in here and there when we could. I helped out a lot with the character,
        their dash ablility, the sword weapon, the enemies, and the puzzles.
