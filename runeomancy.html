        Runeomancy is a game made in
        <a href="https://phaser.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          ><u>Phaser</u></a
        >
        throughout the course of a week. It was made by 3 students who were
        really interested in making a unique magic system that they had never
        seen in a game before. <br /><br />
        It's a puzzle game where the player has 3 different "runes" (bound to 1,2, & 3) and the runes can be combined to make 6 different spells all with a different function. The player then uses these different spells to solve puzzles presented to them in a 2D level.

        Level Design: <br />
        I was in charge of designing the levels to make sure that we were
        designing creative puzzles that the player could solve using our rune
        system of casting spells. I designed a bunch of levels but we only ended
        up implementing one that served as the tutorial for our "demo." The game
        was made in Phaser, so I learned how to use

        to properly implement the tileset that one of my teammates had made.

        Gameplay Programming: <br />
        I was in charge of programming and designing our character. I coded all
        the movement and interactions between our character, the world, and the
        various spells that the other team members worked on.
