        in the span of 3 days. It's only 400 lines of code, and I also took the time to make it a fully functional web app that can be downloaded and played offline, and even downloaded and played on the phone via the web app. <br> <br>
        Crisp-Game-Lib is a JavaScript library that can make simple games. The library itself is very constrained, with a lot of the heavy lifting of making a game done by the designer and creative workarounds to simplistic implementation. <br> <br>
        I had a lot of fun making this game in a short period of time, and making something in a very constrained library was interesting. The funniest constraint to work with was that each actor/object was tied to a single letter of the alphabet. So at max you had 26 objects, and that was just something I had to work around while making this game.
