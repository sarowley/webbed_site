        It was made over the course of two weeks by 5 students who all really enjoyed Valheim and wanted to delve deeper into the world. <br><br>
        It was made on a Miro board, and is played by the player(s) dragging around tokens and cards to simulate playing a physical card game. We based the rules and actions on what the player is able to do within Valheim, but we also took some liberty to make it as fun and interesting of a board game that we could.

    <!-- What I did -->

    <h2 style="color: white; padding-left: 20px">What I did:</h2>
    <h3 style="color: white; padding-left: 20px">
      <div class="textbox">
        Level Design: <br />
        I did the design of the map. We did a lot of playtesting, and after a
        good deal of iteration, I ended up with the final map that you can see
        on the Miro board. <br /><br />
        Rules: <br />
        I was the one who wrote all the rules out and worked really hard on
        making all the rules clear and understandable, along with making the
        rule document themed to get people into the mood of the game before they
        even start playing it. <br /><br />
        Game Design: <br />
        I helped out a lot on all the other parts of the game as well. This
        included helping with balancing, creating all the item cards, along
        with making the legend and placing everything in the Miro board so it's
        accessible and easy to move around.
